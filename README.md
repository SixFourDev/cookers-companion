## What Is Cookers Companion?
Cookers Companion is a website that allows the user to find recipes, save them and search for even more. The website is user friendly and accessible. The webpage populates the top searches for the day and has a login, signup and accessible navigation and search bar. Cookers Companion has access to recipes that include dairy free, gluten free, and vegan options. We hope you enjoy navigating our website!

## Navbar
The purpose of the navbar is to have the 5 main links, a search bar, and a weather app to show you temperature in your area. The search bar helps the user look up recipes with certain keywords, if the user enters the word chicken, then the results will take you to a new html and show you recipes with chicken. The search bar also has an autofill feature which lets the user quickly enter a keyword. The navbar also houses links to a login and signup page.

## Purpose:
The purpose of the webpage is to give the users the oppurtunity to turn their home into their favorite restaurant. We hope the page is fun for cooking alone, cooking with loved ones or even just browsing.

## Repo folders:

In this repo you will find multiple JS files for recipe-details, home page, sign-up, login page, and suggestions page. you will also find style sheets for all of the above mentioned files as well as html files too. Our group has combined the files and created one website that functions throughout the different files.
