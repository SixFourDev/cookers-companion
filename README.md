# cookers-companion

## Purpose:
The purpose of the Cooker's Companion is to give the users the oppurtunity to turn their home into their favorite restaurant. We hope the page is fun for cooking alone, cooking with loved ones or even just browsing.

## What Is Cookers Companion?
Cookers Companion is a website that allows the user to find recipes, save them and search for even more. The website is user friendly and accessible. The webpage populates the top searches for the day and has a login, signup and accessible navigation and search bar. Cookers Companion has access to recipes that include dairy free, gluten free, and vegan options. We hope you enjoy navigating our website!

## Navbar
The purpose of the navbar is to have the 5 main links, a search bar, and a weather app to show you temperature in your area. The search bar helps the user look up recipes with certain keywords, if the user enters the word chicken, then the results will take you to a new html and show you recipes with chicken. The search bar also has an autofill feature which lets the user quickly enter a keyword. The navbar also houses links to a login and signup page.

## Repo folders:

In this repo you will find multiple JS files that supported the website to be interactive. You will also find style sheets for all of the HTML files that this repo holds. Our group has combined the files and created one website that functions throughout the different files.

### Search Bar
* To use the search bar, simply type whichever type of cuisine you'd like to know a recipe on, or even an ingredient like "chicken" and hit enter. You will then get brought to a new page of 20 different recipes that contain that ingredient. It will display the title of the cuisine, the type of cuisine it is, and a view recipe button that you are able to click that will bring you to another page with the recipe title, recipe image, recipe ingredients, and directions.
